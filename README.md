# Manga Scraping Python Script

You will provide the link of the manga. This script will download the chapters.

I've initially made this script to load offline manga in the [Mihon](https://mihon.app/https:/) app (which is an open source android manga reading app).

Currently this script only works on `1st-kissmanga.net` (this website is not sketchy as it seems ðŸ˜‚)

##### Before running the script, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

```
    requests
    beautifulsoup4
    tqdm
```

### File Structure

The downloaded files will be organized in the following structure:

```
    Manga_Name/
    â”‚
    â”œâ”€â”€ cover.jpg (or other image format)
    â”œâ”€â”€ .nomedia
    â”œâ”€â”€ chapter_1/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ image1.jpg
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ image2.jpg
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
    â”œâ”€â”€ chapter_2/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ image1.jpg
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ image2.jpg
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
    â””â”€â”€ ...
```

### How to run the script?

- Run the `main.py` file.
